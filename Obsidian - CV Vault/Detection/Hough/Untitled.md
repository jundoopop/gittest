The Hough transform is a technique used to detect lines in an image. 

Instead of representing lines in the Cartesian coordinate system (using the slope-intercept form �=��+�y=mx+b), the Hough transform represents lines in the polar coordinate system using two parameters: ρ (rho) and θ (theta).

- ρ (rho) is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line.
- θ (theta) is the angle between the x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the closest point on the line.

In the Hough transform space (often called the "accumulator" space), each point in the original image corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in the �−�ρ−θ space. The intersection of these curves indicates the presence of a line in the original image.

To visualize this, imagine a line in the Cartesian plane. For every possible orientation (�θ) of this line, there's a unique distance (�ρ) from the origin to the closest point on the line. As you change �θ, �ρ will change as well, tracing out a sinusoidal curve in the �−�ρ−θ space.

When using the Hough transform to detect lines in an image, you're essentially looking for points in the �−�ρ−θ space where many of these sinusoidal curves intersect, indicating the presence of a line in the original image.

Unfortunately, I couldn't provide a direct visual example from Wolfram|Alpha, but I hope this explanation helps clarify the concept. If you have further questions or need more details, please let me know!
