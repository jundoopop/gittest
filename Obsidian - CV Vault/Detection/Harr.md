##### Paul Viola and Michael Jones

### GPT Summarisation
###### 1. Integral Image Representation

Quick Computation:
Crucial for **rapid feature** evaluation, enabling a detector to process images quickly.

###### 2. AdaBoost Learning Algorithm

Select a small number of crucial visual features from a larger set, resulting in highly efficient classifiers.
-> Crucial for **rapid** detection, computational load **reduction**

###### 3. Cascade of Classifiers

This work combines classifiers in a cascade structure

###### Abstract

eigen-faces for recognition and interactive search in a large-scale face database.

Modular eigenspace observation

##### 1. Introduction

Face recognition -> similar to rigid and roughly convex objects.

##### 2. A large face database

7 562 images of approximately 3 000 people.

gender, race, approximate age, facial expression and other salient features.
e.g) senior Caucasian males with mustaches, or adult Hispanic females with hats.
