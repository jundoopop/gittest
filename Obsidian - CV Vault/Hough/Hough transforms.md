### Hough Transform

**Brief Description:**
- The Hough transform is a technique used to isolate features of **specific shapes within an image**.
- It's commonly used for detecting regular curves like lines, circles, ellipses, etc.
- A generalized Hough transform can detect features without a simple analytic description.
- The classical Hough transform focuses on regular curves and is widely applied due to its tolerance to gaps in feature boundaries and its resistance to image noise.

**How It Works:**
- The Hough technique computes a global description of features based on local measurements.
- Each input (e.g., a coordinate point) contributes to a globally consistent solution (e.g., the line from which the image point originated).
- Lines can be described using parametric or normal notation, where [[rho]] is the length of a normal from the origin to the line, and \( \theta \) is the orientation with respect to the X-axis.
- In image analysis, the coordinates of edge segments are known, making \( \rho \) and \( \theta \) the variables to determine.
- Points in the image space map to curves (sinusoids) in the Hough parameter space. Collinear points in the image space intersect at a common point in the Hough space.
- The transform uses an accumulator array to quantify the Hough parameter space. Each point is transformed into a discretized curve, and accumulator cells along this curve are incremented. Peaks in the accumulator indicate the presence of a straight line in the image.

**Guidelines for Use:**
- The Hough transform identifies the parameters of a curve fitting a set of edge points.
- Edge descriptions are usually obtained from feature-detecting operators like the [Roberts Cross](roberts.htm), [Sobel](sobel.htm), or [Canny](canny.htm) edge detector.
- The Hough transform determines the features and their quantity in the image.
- The transform can detect straight line segments, revealing the true geometric structure of the subject.
- The Hough technique is robust to noise and can detect features even with gaps in the feature boundary.

**Common Variants:**
- **Generalized Hough Transform:** Used when the feature's shape doesn't have a simple analytic equation. Instead of a parametric equation, a look-up table defines the relationship between boundary positions, orientations, and Hough parameters.

**Interactive Experimentation:**
- The page provides a link for users to [interactively experiment](houghdemo.htm) with the Hough transform.

**Exercises:**
- The page offers various exercises to help users understand and apply the Hough transform, such as finding the Hough line transform of specific objects, investigating the algorithm's robustness to image noise, and using the generalized Hough transform to detect octagons.

**References:**
- Several references are provided for further reading, including works by D. Ballard, C. Brown, R. Boyle, R. Thomas, A. Jain, and D. Vernon.

**Local Information:**
- Specific information about the Hough transform operator can be found [here](local/hough.txt). More general advice about the local HIPR installation is available in the [Local Information](local.htm) section.

The page provides a comprehensive overview of the Hough transform, its applications, and its variants. It also offers interactive experimentation and exercises to deepen understanding.
