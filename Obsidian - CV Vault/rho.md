[In the **Hough Transform**, the parameter **rho** (ρ) is used to represent the distance from the origin to a line in polar coordinates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines)[2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/hough.html). [The origin in this context refers to the **top-left corner of the image**](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/hough.html)[2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/hough.html). [The Hough Transform algorithm calculates **rho** using the equation **ρ = x * cosθ + y * sinθ**, where (x, y) are the line parameters and θ is the angle between the line and the x-axis](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines).

The **rho** parameter plays a crucial role in the Hough Transform.

[It determines the “fatness” of a row in the accumulator, which is a 2D histogram used to detect lines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines). 

A larger value of **rho** results in wider accumulator rows, potentially causing similar lines to fall into the same bucket. [On the other hand, a smaller value of **rho** increases the precision of the detection by separating similar lines into different buckets](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531468/explanation-of-rho-and-theta-parameters-in-houghlines).

To summarise, **rho** is a distance parameter that represents the distance from the origin to a line in polar coordinates. It affects the width of the accumulator rows and influences the precision of line detection in the Hough Transform.
