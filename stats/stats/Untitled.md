Certainly! To understand how Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) works in linear regression and how the least squares estimators are derived using partial derivatives, leading to the normal equations, let's delve into the concepts step by step.

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in Linear Regression:

- **Goal**: The primary goal of OLS in linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points.

- **Best-Fitting Line**: This is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model.

### Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):

- **Definition**: SSE is the sum of the squares of the residuals. For each data point, you calculate the difference between the observed value and the value predicted by the model, square this difference, and then sum all these squared values.

- **Formula**: For a simple linear regression with a single independent variable, \( SSE = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \sum (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2 \), where \( y_i \) is the observed value, \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value, \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept, and \( \beta_1 \) is the slope of the line.

### Partial Derivation and Normal Equations:

- **Partial Derivatives**: To minimize the SSE, we take the partial derivative of the SSE with respect to each coefficient (\( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \)) and set these derivatives to zero. This process leads to the normal equations.

- **Derivation for \( \beta_0 \)**:

  - Take the partial derivative of SSE with respect to \( \beta_0 \) and set it to zero: \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_0} SSE = 0 \).

  - This leads to the equation: \( \sum y_i = n\beta_0 + \beta_1 \sum x_i \), where \( n \) is the number of observations.

- **Derivation for \( \beta_1 \)**:

  - Take the partial derivative of SSE with respect to \( \beta_1 \) and set it to zero: \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_1} SSE = 0 \).

  - This leads to the equation: \( \sum x_i y_i = \beta_0 \sum x_i + \beta_1 \sum x_i^2 \).

### Solving the Normal Equations:

- The normal equations are a set of simultaneous linear equations in two variables (\( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \)). By solving these equations, we find the values of \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) that minimize the SSE.

- The solutions to these equations give us the least squares estimates for the coefficients of the linear regression model.

### Conclusion:

- In summary, the method of partial derivatives in the context of OLS is used to find the values of \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) that minimize the SSE. This process results in the normal equations, which when solved, provide the coefficients for the best-fitting linear model according to the criterion of least squares. This approach ensures that the linear model is the most accurate representation of the data, in terms of minimizing the sum of the squared residuals.
