**Coordinate Representation**: The x-coordinate and y-coordinate representations are methods for representing a region at the level of each pattern element composing the region and, thus, are one-level representations.

**Linear transformations**: Linear transformations are described completely by their actions on a basis for the domain. Every linear transformation from one finite-dimensional vector space to another can be represented by a matrix that is basis dependent.

**Integral Transforms**: Integral transforms are useful tools for solving differential and integral equations, as well as for analyzing various physical phenomena. Some examples of integral transforms are Fourier transform, Laplace transform, and Hankel transform.

**Quantum Optics**: Quantum optics is the study of the interaction of light and matter at the quantum level. It deals with phenomena such as photon emission and absorption, coherent states, entanglement, and quantum information processing.

**Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals**: Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of microscopic systems, such as atoms and electrons. It is based on the concepts of wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, superposition principle, and Schr√∂dinger equation.

**Radiative Corrections**: Radiative corrections are the effects of quantum fluctuations on physical observables, such as scattering cross-sections and energy levels. They arise from the emission and absorption of virtual photons by charged particles.
